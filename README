Dropbox Uploader is a BASH script which can be used to upload, download, delete or list files from Dropbox, an online file sharing, synchronization and backup service. 

It's written in BASH scripting language and only needs cURL.

Why use this script?

Portable: It's written in BASH scripting language and only needs cURL (curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, available for all operating systems and installed by default in many linux distributions).
Secure:It's not required to provide your username/password to this script, because it uses the official Dropbox API for authentication process. 

USAGE:
======

Usage: ./dropbox_uploader.sh COMMAND [PARAMETERS]...

[%%]: Required param 
<%%>: Optional param

Commands:

 upload   [LOCAL_FILE]  <REMOTE_FILE> 
 - Upload local file to remote Dropbox folder
   If the file is bigger than 150Mb the file is uploaded using small chunks (default 50Mb); in this case,
   if VERBOSE is set to 1, a . (dot) is printed when every chunk is successfully uploaded. Instead, if an
   error occurs during the chunk uploading, an * (star) is printed and the upload is retried for a maximum
   of three times.
   Only if the file is smaller than 150Mb, the standard upload API is used, and if VERBOSE is set to 1 the 
   default curl progression bar is displayed during the upload process.

 download [REMOTE_FILE] <LOCAL_FILE>  
 - Download file from Dropbox to local folder

 delete   [REMOTE_FILE] 
 - Remove a remote file from Dropbox

 list     <REMOTE_DIRECTORY>
 - List contents of the remote Dropbox folder
 
 info
