# Dropbox Uploader

Dropbox Uploader is a **BASH** script which can be used to upload, download, delete, list files (and more!) from **Dropbox**, an online file sharing, synchronization and backup service. 

It's written in BASH scripting language and only needs **cURL**.

**Why use this script?**

* **Portable:** It's written in BASH scripting and only needs *cURL* (curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, available for all operating systems and installed by default in many linux distributions).
* **Secure:** It's not required to provide your username/password to this script, because it uses the official Dropbox API for the authentication process. 

Please refer to the &lt;Wiki&gt;(https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader/wiki) for tips and additional information about this project. The Wiki is also the place where you can share your scripts and examples related to Dropbox Uploader.

## Features

* Cross platform
* Support for the official Dropbox API
* No password required or stored
* Simple step-by-step configuration wizard
* Simple and chunked file upload
* File and recursive directory download
* File and recursive directory upload
* Shell wildcard expansion (only for upload)
* Delete/Move/Rename/Copy/List files
* Create share link

## Getting started

First, clone the repository using git (recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader/
```

or download the script manually using this command:

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader/master/dropbox_uploader.sh" -o dropbox_uploader.sh
```

Then give the execution permission to the script and run it:

```bash
 $chmod +x dropbox_uploader.sh
 $./dropbox_uploader.sh
```

The first time you run `dropbox_uploader`, you'll be guided through a wizard in order to configure access to your Dropbox. This configuration will be stored in `~/.dropbox_uploader`.

### Configuration wizard

The configuration wizard is pretty self-explanatory. One thing to notice is that if you choose "App permission", your uploads will end up on Dropbox under an `App/<your_app_name>` folder. To have them stored in another folder, such as in `/dir/`, you'll need to give Dropbox-Uploader permission to all Dropbox files.

## Usage

The syntax is quite simple:

```
./dropbox_uploader.sh COMMAND [PARAMETERS]...

[%%]: Optional param
<%%>: Required param
```

**Available commands:**

* **upload** &lt;LOCAL_FILE/DIR ...&gt; &lt;REMOTE_FILE/DIR&gt;  
Upload a local file or directory to a remote Dropbox folder.  
If the file is bigger than 150Mb the file is uploaded using small chunks (default 4Mb); 
in this case a . (dot) is printed for every chunk successfully uploaded and a * (star) if an error 
occurs (the upload is retried for a maximum of three times).
Only if the file is smaller than 150Mb, the standard upload API is used, and if the -p option is used
the default curl progress bar is displayed during the upload process.  
The local file/dir parameter supports wildcards expansion.

* **download** &lt;REMOTE_FILE/DIR&gt; [LOCAL_FILE/DIR]  
Download file or directory from Dropbox to a local folder

* **delete** &lt;REMOTE_FILE/DIR&gt;  
Remove a remote file or directory from Dropbox

* **move** &lt;REMOTE_FILE/DIR&gt; &lt;REMOTE_FILE/DIR&gt;

    ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload *.zip /
    ./dropbox_uploader.sh download /backup.zip
    ./dropbox_uploader.sh delete /backup.zip
    ./dropbox_uploader.sh mkdir /myDir/
    ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload "My File.txt" "My File 2.txt"
    ./dropbox_uploader.sh share "My File.txt"

* Raspberry Pi
* QNAP
* iOS

* Chrome OS
* OpenBSD

If you have successfully tested this script on others systems or platforms please let me know!

## Running as cron job
Dropbox Uploader relies on a different configuration file for each system user. The default configuration file location is HOME_DIRECTORY/.dropbox_uploader. This means that if you do the setup with your user and then you try to run a cron job as root, it won't works.  
So, when running this script using cron, please keep in mind the following:
* Remember to setup the script with the user used to run the cron job
* Use always the -f option to specify the full configuration file path, because sometimes in the cron environment the home folder path is not detected correctly
* My advice is, for security reasons, to not share the same configuration file with different users

## How to setup a proxy

To use a proxy server, just set the **https_proxy** environment variable:

**Linux:**
```bash
    export HTTP_PROXY_USER=XXXX
    export HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD=YYYY
    export https_proxy=http://192.168.0.1:8080
```

**BSD:**
```bash
    setenv HTTP_PROXY_USER XXXX
    setenv HTTP_PROXY_PASSWORD YYYY
    setenv https_proxy http://192.168.0.1:8080
```
   
## BASH and Curl installation

**Debian & Ubuntu Linux:**
```bash
    sudo apt-get install bash (Probably BASH is already installed on your system)
    sudo apt-get install curl
```

**BSD:**
```bash
    cd /usr/ports/shells/bash && make install clean
    cd /usr/ports/ftp/curl && make install clean
```

**Cygwin:**  
You need to install these packages:  
* curl
* ca-certificates
* dos2unix

Before running the script, you need to convert it using the dos2unix command.


**Build cURL from source:**
* Download the source tarball from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
* Follow the INSTALL instructions
